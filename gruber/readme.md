## Gruber Installer
Named after the wonderful Gruber brothers from the Die Hard films this file acts and in installer/unpacker. It should find the corresponding McClane
file, unzip and then place each file in the correct location - ideally meaning that getting my i3 setup back to how I like it will be a "one command" 
job. I am still quite new to scripting so there may be a few "quirks" so if you use it please be forgiving.
